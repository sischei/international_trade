This .zip file contains the programs which accompany the note entitled “Illustrating the Methodology in EKNR (2015): Some Simple Examples”, by Jonathan Eaton, Samuel Kortum, and Brent Neiman. 

The programs are divided into two folders corresponding to the 1- and 2-country cases in the note. Simply run either “EKNR_Simple_1Cty.m” or “EKNR_Simple_2Cty.m”, keeping all other .m and .mat files in the same folder, and the code will execute. The codes load shock values from .mat files, though these are just particular hypothetical examples for concreteness. Each program outputs a .pdf file with a Figure corroborating that the solutions to the levels and change formulations of the problem coincide. 

Where appropriate, please cite the paper, “Eaton, Jonathan, Samuel Kortum, Brent Neiman, and John Romalis (2015): “Trade and the Global Recession.” The full paper and accompanying appendix can be found on the authors’ web pages.
